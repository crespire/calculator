# Calculator
Calculator made with HTML, CSS and JS from The Odin Project foundations course.

**Challenges**

This project has been, by far, the most challenging one I've undertaken in the course. I found the problem really challenging and it was very fun to flex my problem solving skills.

I think my overall approach is solid, but I feel that there is room for improvement in how the code handles negative numbers. I was not able to do the validation logic for that as elegantly as I would have liked, but the end result is that users and input negative numbers and get correct calculations.

# TODO
* Calculator current stops taking inputs once it displays a BigInt. Challenge is in the + or - symbol after the e, I suspect.
